*FlightBench* is an open-source comprehensive benchmark for planning methods on ego-vision-based navigation for quadrotors built on [Flightmare](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/flightmare). *FlightBench* provides cusomizable test scenarios (including three quantitative task difficulty metrics), representative planning algorithms, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. FlightBench also integrates the [MAPPO](https://github.com/marlbenchmark/on-policy) algorithm, facilitating the training of RL-based planning methods.
